# Patent Semantic Search

## Description

Semantic search in patents is to find similar patents based on the meaning of contexts instead of keywords. It greatly expands the search experience for users 
and makes search engine smarter. However, technical jargons in patents and linguistic ontology are the challenges. 
This project is to explore an ML/AI approach of automating semantic search on patents. We leverage data engineering, machine learning and artificial intelligence
 to build up a model for improving the semantic search with minimal manual interference. 

## Table of Contents
   - Data folder. It includes two dataset: seed and antiseed. They have publication number and title. In order to find abstracts, they must be added to Google Console. 
                        Please see more information in [Google Bigquery Instructions](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/codelabs/cpb200-loading-data/#0)
   - Slides(Capstone Project 2. pptx). It has the analysis of seed, antiseed and expanded dataset
   - Milestone project report. It shows the project purpose, data wrangling, analysis and cleaning in details.
   - Main.ipynb. It interactively shows every step how to finish the process.  

## Requirements

   * Python 3 or above
   * Google Bigquery
   * Tensorflow and Keras
   * Other Python Utilities

## To be continued

I am still working on the ML/AI model for that. I would upload the entire project right after completing them.
